# Quick Glossary

::left::

<v-click>

## Bundling

> Using tools that crawl, process and concatenate our source modules into files that can run in the browser.

</v-click>

::right::

<v-click>

## Modules

> Mechanisms for splitting JavaScript programs up into separate modules that can be imported when needed.

</v-click>

<!--
- Very quickly want to give you a glossary of these terms in case they're completely new to
- think any file is going to be a module

- module is a term that you come across when working with javascript packages OR frontend bundlers such as webpack

- we'll go through these a bit more later, so all good if that doesn't make sense

</v-clicks>


<!--
- We are back in time, to the Stone age. 

- When we had no tools

- Everything was manual, you'd google minify css or minify js and copy the output

- It was a pretty nice time though no build steps, no node_modules, just downloaded the dependencies we needed

- Caching wasn't really a thing

- We use modules which are called IIFE

- We don't talk about anything before the stone age

- Who amongst us is was part of this? Maybe you still build your sites like this?

# Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)

> IIFE modules were the first way we could split our code into separate files. 

<v-click>

- Immediately invoked functions that are wrapped in a closure, allowing a private scope for code.

</v-click>

<v-click>

```javascript {all|1,7|2}
(function () {
  window.$myLib = {
    greeting() {
      console.log('Hello world!')
    }
  }
})();
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

```html {3}
<script src="./myLib.js" type="text/javascript" />
<script>
$myLib.greeting()
</script>
```

</v-click>

<!--
- Immediately Invoked Function Expressions

- You may have seen these, this is how popular libraries were packaged, they would add their APIs to the global scope

- Think jQuery or bootstrap

- Very simple, just run the code and let it do its thing
-->

---
layout: section
size: sm

# HTML Example

```html {all|4,7}
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <script type="text/javascript" href="./lib/jquery-2.1.3.min.js" />
</head>
<body>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="./app-concat.min.js" />
</body>
</html>
```

<!--
- A basic example of what it looked like, pretty easy and nice
- so the jQuery there would be an IIFE module
-->

---
layout: section
size: xl
---

# Stone Age Problems

- IIFE modules are big, websites getting slow 
- Maintaining third-party code is not fun
- Many cross browser bugs

<!--
- IIFE were very difficult to optimise, you'd need to roll your own version of a package only picking the things you were going to use

- The browser engines were way out of sync, you'd run into a lot of issues when testing between the browsers of what was supported, what needed vendor prefixes, etc

- Apps and bundling getting more complex, task Runners are needed (Grunt, Gulp)
- Angular joins the chat
- Ecosystem divides on modules, transpiling for node or the browser (CJS, AMD, UMD, IIFE)

</v-clicks>


<!--
- Now we enter the bronze age

- The era of "It's a web app actually", our web tools are getting better and more complicated as the scope of our websites grow

- Lot of interesting tools as you can see there, Laravel Elixir is worth noting which was an abstraction of gulp, similar to Laravel Mix but for Laravel 4/5

- The paradigm was on "Task Running", so having a pipeline of tasks to execute things

- So begins in the Bronze age the great Module wars, as you can see there, we now have four competing module types

- Let's see what different they have

# CommonJS (CJS)

> CommonJS modules are the original way to package JavaScript code for Node.js. 

<v-click>

- They are synchronous and are loaded at runtime.

</v-click>

<v-click>

```javascript {1}
modules.exports.greeting = function() {
  console.log('Hello world!')
}
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

```javascript {1}
const $myLib = require('./myLib.js')
$myLib.greeting()
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

- Browser: <material-symbols-cancel-rounded class="text-red-300" /> requires transpiling
- Node <material-symbols-check-circle class="text-green-300" />

</v-click>

<!--
- standard 

- CommonJS modules were the original way to package JavaScript code for Node.js.
- A browser does not understand this so would need to be transpiled
- Fairly easy to optimise

- advantages of code reusability and sharing, especially with NPM up and running now
-->

---
layout: section

# Async Module Definition (AMD)

> AMD modules are the original way to package JavaScript code for the browser. 

<v-click>

- They are asynchronous and are loaded at runtime. Created by RequireJS.

</v-click>


<v-click>

```javascript {1,7}
define(function () {
    return { greeting: function () { console.log('Hello world!') }  };
});
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

```javascript {1}
const $myLib = require('./myLib.js')
$myLib.greeting()
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

- Browser & Node: <material-symbols-check-circle class="text-green-300" /> (with Require.js, no transpiling needed)

</v-click>

<!--
- AMD was developed by Require.js
- It did work in the browser but wasn't easy to optimize, no transpiling needed
-->

---
layout: section
size: xl

# Universal Module Definition (UMD)

> UMD modules are a way to package JavaScript code for the browser and Node.js.

<v-click>

- Aims to be compatible with both CommonJS and AMD

</v-click>

<v-click>

```javascript  {all|10}
(function (root, factory) {
    if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {
        define([], factory);
    } else if (typeof module === 'object' && module.exports) {
        module.exports = factory();
    } else {
        root.returnExports = factory();
  }
}(typeof self !== 'undefined' ? self : this, function () {
    return { greeting () { console.log('Hello World') } };
}));
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

- Browser & Node: <material-symbols-check-circle class="text-green-300" />

</v-click>

<!--
- UMD was a way to ship a package that could be used from AMD or CommonJS module
- Bit complex and hacky
-->

---
layout: two-cols

# Bronze Age Problems

- Many competing tools and module standards
- Task runners are not always intuitive and painful to configure
- Builds are slow, full rebuilds needed for code changes
- The ecosystem is not efficient, hard for packages to leverage each other's code

<!--
- bit of frustration out of this age, package authors were fighting against the standards
- devs were struggling to configure these task runners
- build times were slow
- Overall the ecosystem wasn't efficient

- Seriously complex apps are being built

</v-clicks>

<!--
- webpack came out at a similar time to Gulp, but Gulp had a lot more traction
- eventually webpack took over once the loader ecosystem caught up
- around the same time as babel

- babel let you write ES6 code and transpile it to something Node and the browser could understand

# Webpack

> Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript applications.

<v-clicks>

- Dev Server with Hot Module Replacement
- Code Splitting
- Tree Shaking
- Dependency graph resolving
- Module bundling
- Asset bundling
- Code minification

</v-clicks>

---
layout: section

---

# Dev Server (Hot Module Replacement)

<v-clicks>

- Use an HTTP server (express) to serve build modules locally
- Websocket communicating file changes so modules can be reloaded (HMR)
- HMR requires code to be in a module standard unless you want to reload everything

</v-clicks>

---
layout: section
size: sm
---

# Code Splitting

<v-clicks>

- Split your code into multiple bundles to optimise performance
- Bundles: vendor, app, lib, etc
- Dynamic imports
- e.g. separate pages js/css and vendor code into their own bundles

</v-clicks>

<!--
- when you build your code you can provide some hints to webpack on how the code should be split into different bundles

- historically you would have say a vendor bundle with all your node_Modules

- say a app bundle with all your code

- maybe a lib bundle with all your frameworks code

- but yeh splitting for pages
-->

---
layout: section
---

# Tree Shaking

<v-clicks>

- Remove dead code
- Only use code we need from external modules
- Only use code we need from our own code
- e.g. Use a single function from lodash instead of loading the entire package
- e.g. Use a single component from a UI library instead of loading the entire package

</v-clicks>


---
layout: section

# Iron Age Problems

<v-clicks>

- Incredibly painful to understand, configure and debug webpack
- Builds are not scaling well, getting very slow as application grows
- Lots of boilerplate
- node_modules big

</v-clicks>

<!--
- because you're transpiling everything before you start, it's very slow
-->

- Release of ES6, requires Babel to use
- Greater need for module compatibility with Server Side Rendering gaining popularity
- Webpack abstraction layers and frameworks released
- ESM modules start gaining some traction, but have poor support
- Rollup, a nicer API than webpack and more performant

</v-clicks>

<!--
- Middle ages I characterise as ES6 and age of solving webpack

- Solving the complexity of configuring, which showed itself through abstraction layers and frontend frameworks, such as Laravel Mix, Nuxt, Next, etc

- Babel which was a core loader of webpack had performance issues which people wanted to solve, specifically esbuild

- With the ecosystem now using each others packages more, we needed a stricter way and less buggy way to communicate package APIs, hense the shift of things towards TypeScript

- Rollup grew out of the frustrations of the webpack API and documentation

# Takeaways

- Vite was the natural next step of the frontend ecosystem with ESM modules getting node and browser support

- New ecosystem efficiency is unlocked with aligning at a low / mid level and on the ESM module standard

- Has taken almost 6 years for Browsers and Node to support a language update (ES5 -> ES6)

<!--
# Takeaways

- Relative to the PHP world, frontend has had a lot of inefficiencies in working togethor due to competing technologies

- Things are getting better with language agnostic tools like Vite and standards being agreed on (ESM)

- CJS is slowly losing relevance but will be around for a while

- Browsers are now catching up with WebKit adoption, we'll need to do less to make code production ready
